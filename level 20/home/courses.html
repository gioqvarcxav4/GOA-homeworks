    <h2>About Our Courses at Global Oriented Academy</h2>
    <p>

        At Global Oriented Academy, we offer a range of programming courses for learners of all ages, starting from 9 years old. We also provide individual lessons for children aged 7-11 in the comfort of their own homes. For adult learners, we offer special groups for those 18 and over. Our flexible course schedule allows you to choose from four, three, two, or even one lesson per week based on your preference. Our courses are designed to guide you through a basic level (1 year) or an advanced, in-depth course (2.5 years, depending on the student's interests). Successful students have the opportunity to work with Global Oriented Academy and its partner companies.
