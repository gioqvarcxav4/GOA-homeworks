    <h1>Different areas of programming</h1>
    <p>Looking at the broad word itself Programming, it's clear without a doubt that it comprises many branches, here is a list of some areas of programming that anyone can specialise in:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Web Development:

                <li>Web development involves creating websites, web applications, and other web-related tasks. It's often broken into several other sub-branches which are arguably big enough to stand as a separate branch in the programming world.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mobile App Development:
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile app development involves creating mobile applications for Android and iOS devices. although the two operating system doesn't sync, there are still under the same branch.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Game Development:
                <ul>
                    <li>Game development involves creating video games for various platforms. To become productive in this field, you can start by learning Unity or Unreal Engine, which can take about 6-12 months to learn.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </li>
        <li>Machine Learning:
            <ul>
                <li>Machine learning involves teaching machines to learn and make predictions based on data, this field requires some knowledge of mathematics and is one of the toughest areas of specialization in programming.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Data Science:
            <ul>
                <li>Data science involves extracting insights from data, cleaning them and presenting them in different formats according to described requirements.

                    To become productive in this field, you can start with Python, R, and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which can take about 6-12 months to learn.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>DevOps:
            <ul>
                <li>DevOps involves automating the software development process, it also includes cloud resources management, and building and maintaining CICD pipelines.

                    To become productive in this field, one can start learning tools like Git, Jenkins, and Docker, which can take about 3-6 months to learn.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
